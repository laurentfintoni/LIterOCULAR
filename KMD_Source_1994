<p class="subheader">After a three year hiatus, KMD’s new album <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span> finds a hardened, reflective <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span> still struggling with his brother's untimely death.</p>

<p><span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span> seems to be in low spirits. Dressed in black like a mourner, he sits in the dimly-lit conference room, waving a blunt and clouding the air. The smoke makes it hard to see him. His homie sips from an almost-empty 40 of Olde E. It’s one in the afternoon. His label’s offices are in the <span id="#" class="mention-organization" about="Time-Warner">Time- Warner</span> building; a mortuary, really, for uncompromising ghetto music. The offices are filled with white employees, vampires, creeps and other assorted ghouls blasting the label’s newest grunge band. It’s difficult to feel comfortable sitting in the belly of the corporate hydra which both censors <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="hip-hop">hip-hop</span> records and pimps it in their “upscale” <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="hip-hop">hip-hop</span> magazine.</p>

<p><span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> seems to have more on his mind than self promotion. His brother <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>, the other member of <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> (Kausing Much Damage), was killed by a car just as the group’s new album was completed. His features seem hardened, his face not as innocent as it was a mere three years ago. Gone are the striped shirts and wire-frame glasses seen in ads for the group’s debut <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span>. Instead, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> affects the paramilitary fashion of the incoming generation’s disenfranchised street soldiers.</p>

<p>“I can’t fuck with all that image shit, being under-somebody’s-coattails bullshit,” he says today, as if to disavow his past. His frown tells me he was unhappy with aspects of how all parties involved were handling his career. <span id="#" class="mention-label" about="Elektra">Elektra</span>, he implies, under-promoted <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span> to ghetto audiences and marketed the group as Native Tonguers, constructing an image around the song <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="Peachfuzz">“Peachfuzz”</span> as opposed to <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="NittyGritty">“Nitty Gritty,”</span> which truly represented the group’s philosophies. <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="Peachfuzz">“Peachfuzz”</span> was a puppy-love song; <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="NittyGritty">“Nitty Gritty,”</span> found them dissing all devils with their cohorts <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="BrandNubian">Brand Nubian</span>.</p>

<p>“I feel a lot of things changed from our original idea as opposed to now, where we got to keep all the real shit,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> says. “Our first time, we didn’t even know how to fuck with it: shit fucking up, everybody getting in between this creative shit...” With <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span>, he says the group stuck to their guns and produced the music they were making before they were discovered by <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Serch">MC Serch</span> in <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongBeach">Long Beach</span>, <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongIsland">Long Island</span>. This time, no values were compromised.</p>

<p>Inspired by <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="LastPoets">Last Poet</span> <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="GylanKain">Gylan Kain</span>’s raw Afrocentric spoken <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="jazz">jazz</span> (<span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Gylan Kain">Kain</span>’s <span id="#" class="mention-sample" about="BlueGuerilla">Blue Guerilla</span> album), <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span> is an intelligent response to a society where death is usually random, senseless and violent. At times <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> is a centrist, wavering between life affirmation and out-and-out nihilism. One song talks about hitting people with wine bottles (<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="SweetPremium">“Sweet Premium”</span>); another boasts of a new .380 (<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="GetUNow">“Get U Now”</span>); two vignettes analyze love-hate relationships with lousy women (<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="Plumskinz">“Plumskinz”</span>); one finds him embroiled in the battle over the word “nigga” (<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="WhatANiggyKnow">“What A Niggy Know”</span>); <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="SmokingThatShit">“Smoking That Shit”</span> and <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="ContactBlitt">“Contact Blitt”</span> both espouse the virtues of being <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="hip-hop">hip-hop</span> potheads (the former featuring <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="KuriousJorge">Kurious Jorge</span>, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="LordSear">Lord Sear</span> and <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Earthquake">Earthquake</span>); while the title track isolates <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ParkerLewis">MC Parker Lewis</span> and whites who use words like mackadocious. The album is a more powerful, more relevant work-focused, sophisticated and streetwise—without the crossover friendly abstractions. Listeners are instead provided with a street level analysis of a society gone mad. The world has changed and, with it, <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span>.</p>

<p><span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> exhales like a dragon, stoically answers questions, saying as little as possible, laughing to himself. He maintains a tight grip on his emotions.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t even with him that day, but the shit was shady,” he says of <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>. “I don’t know. I don’t wanna get into details really.” What he does say: on the fateful day, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> was harassed by police officers in front of his home and taken into custody for an outstanding warrant from 1989. “For drinking a couple of beers, trying to take me in for some bullshit. So I’m locked up for four hours and didn’t see him till the next day. I don’t know. That's how it happened really.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out?” I ask, recalling the November phone call I received about my brother Jay. “I felt it. I felt it definitely,” he reflects. “I called my moms up right after that.” I recognized his tone of voice—the numbness, the shock, the disbelief and ultimately, the acceptance that someone is gone forever. When my brother Jay’s wife died of AIDS, leaving him with three children and a mind crammed with bittersweet memories, he began to drink heavily. His eyes were dull; he no longer gave a fuck about living. A year later, I stood by his closed casket. “Shit was real like that,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> continues, oblivious to my thoughts. “I forgot who told me in words. I just knew.”</p>

<p>Many <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> insiders insist that <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> is in a state of denial. “<span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> used to be able to articulate his thoughts in such a clear way,” one insider says. “But now he’s sullen. Using beer and getting zooted as a crutch instead of facing things and trying to work it out.”</p>

<p>Death has cast a shadow on <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span>, yet he pretends it hasn’t. It has made him take a more realistic look at his life, the people in it and what he has to do with it. He realizes you only live once and have no time to please other people by being anyone other than yourself. This whole record shit he knows is temporary. At any minute, label executives can cut him off and send him back to relative obscurity (as they have done to so many others who have proved unprofitable).</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> tells me. “Niggaz be passing away so much. The shit is crazy now. To tell you the truth, you just don’t give a fuck no more. I mean, you give a fuck, you care about what goes on... but to a point where you now know that shit is real.” It has always been real, I tell him.</p>

<p>I ask if listening to, and having to promote the <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span> album is a bother, if hearing <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>’s voice doesn’t reopen painful wounds. He leans forward in his seat. His voice grows a little more forceful. “It seems like I’m listening to two different people, to tell you the truth. I'm not even that motherfucker from before. I don’t know. Different times. What I’m doing now, creatively, is totally different. It’s like him-and-me-combined-as-one type shit.” His voice is tense, his answers stiff. I ask if he’s uncomfortable talking about this.</p>

<p>“Nah, I never did before,” he deflects. “Does it sound like I’m stuttering or something? Ask me anything. I wanna talk.”</p>

<p>When he listens to the music, he remembers “the exact time” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Sub</span> approached him with new lyrics, when <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Sub</span> would barge in and say, “Yo check this shit, it’s butter, bust it, I’m’a flip it.” His voice slides into what may be an accurate impersonation of <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Sub</span>’s enthusiastic tone. “When he was doing it for me,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> monotones, his mind possibly filled with pictures of when they recorded home demos on a 4-track and an admittedly lousy Casio sampler. “I remember that shit just like yesterday,” he continues, memories swimming through his eyes like fish. “It seems like one point in time, stuck there, can’t change.”</p>

<blockquote>COON PERSECUTION: <SPAN ID="#" CLASS="MENTION-PERSON" ABOUT="ZEVLOVEX">ZEV</SPAN>'S SAMBO FIGURE WAS SIMPLY BANNED LAST ALBUM (BELOW). THIS TIME, HE RETURNS LARGER, MORE OMINOUS AND WITH AN EYE JAMMIE.</blockquote>

<p>Their mother is coping, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> continues, nodding his head and considering her pain. “She went through crazy shit as well,” he nods. “Word.” There is a lull in the conversation, a prolonged silence speaking volumes. This is not the interview I want to be conducting. This is the last thing I need to be thinking about. Life is not going too hot these days.</p>

<p>“It’s like this: the physical body is not us anyway,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> continues, equating visiting a grave to “worshipping graven images.” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>’s presence is numinous, he tells me. “So the whole ‘physical form’ shit is mad wack.” He pauses, toking on the blunt. He knows that <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span> will live on through the good deeds he did in life, through his music and in people’s loving memories. But still the pain is deep. After a second, he stares into his lap, shakes a Newport out of his pack and says, “I feel like a fucking piece of bullshit.” His face is a mask of torment. “Plus, smoking cigarettes? I know this ain’t me. This can’t be me for real.”</p>

<blockquote>“WHEN I'M GONE, EXPECT ME BACK TO HAUNT”
—<span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>Subroc, “It Sounded Like A Roc”</blockquote>

<p>The death of a loved one brings unexpected emotions: guilt, anger, hate, sadness. Were we there when they needed us? Were we angry with the other when they died? Did we really treat them right? How could they leave us like this? While we question our own mortality we’re forced to remember death is a natural part of life. Death is the one thing we all must inevitably face. <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> sits there, waiting for the next question. We shift gears.</p>

<p>Why <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span>?</p>

<p>“I did that on purpose,” he says, “Bold title, bold statement. To make a mockery of this bullshit system of censorship.” I ask about the song <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="ConstipatedMonkeys">“Constipated Monkeys,”</span> about the sample from <span id="#" class="mention-sample" about="BellybuttonWindow">“Bellybutton Window,”</span> a posthumous <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</span> release. “<span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Sub</span> put that whole shit together,” he says reverently. “That shit was flavor.”</p>

<p>“What does the <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="GarbageDay3">‘Garbage Day 3’</span> instrumental represent?” I ask, admitting that it is my favorite track on the album.</p>

<p>“Whatever you hear or pick up out of that is mad short instances of big things,” he answers. “That all just fills the whole gap of when people didn’t see us or whatever.” That explains the tenebrous bass, screams, racial epithets, gunshots and the lugubrious female voice that asks: “It’s not the three of us anymore, is it?”</p>

<p><span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> says that the group <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> will endure “just as long as I can make records out this bitch” waving his hands at the corporate walls. His boy <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</span>, he foresees, will be joining. “Shit evolves like that, you kno’m saying,” he says, accepting that life is a procession and you're supposed to move on. “<span id="#" class="mention-person" about="GrimReaper">Grim</span> and me collaborate on a lot of joints. We're about to come out with some shit in the summertime. But that’s really it. I'm just getting with him. After that, there’ll be no more changes.”</p>

<p>For now, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span> will be at home working on new material and being a father to his two-year-old son. The child, he tells me with a mischievous grin, who brings joy to his life. “He’s two,” he says with a nod. “Yep, bad just like me too. It’s mad fun being a parent,” he continues, his mind off of death and dying, and on life. “Like being little all over again, getting to bug out, play all day.” It’s good to know he has something to make him happy. Death, after all, shouldn’t run our lives.</p>
