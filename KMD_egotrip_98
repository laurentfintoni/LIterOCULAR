<p>“Many Flows. Metal Face. Mic Friendly, Magnetic Field, Money Flow. as well as My Friend and oh yeah—Mutha Fucka.” says <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> in explanation of the M.F. prefix on his name. “The <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> shit is just mad old. Niggas been callin’ me that since I was a shorty, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span>’s just a totally new character of myself. It's still me but it's just a different side.”</p>

<p>In the last three years the life of <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> (the former <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span>, frontman of <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span>) has endured a lot of change: from his crew's days as teenaged Islamic rap scientists to his recent exploits on one of the past year's best independent hip hop 12"s—<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="DeadBent">"Dead Bent"</span> /<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="DeadBent">“Gas Drawls”</span>/<span id="#" class="mention-track" about="Hey">"Hey.”</span> But there's been one constant throughout his entire recording career—his <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongIsland">Long Island</span> residence.</p>

<p>It's only appropriate then, that <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> recaps his experiences on his hometown’s boardwalk in <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongBeach">Long Beach</span>, a stones throw from the Atlantic Ocean. Joining him are Duce (the ex-<span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> member formerly known as <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Onyx">Onyx</span>) and his long-time friend <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Quest">Quest</span> (a/k/a J. Quest The Boogieman). It’s a clear night in the suburban town and from where we sit both sky and water seem to go on forever in every direction.</p>

<p>“<span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongBeach">Long Beach</span> isn't as wide as <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span>, as long as <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="Manhattan">Manhattan</span>, or as dense as the <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="Bronx">Bronx</span>,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> concedes, “But there's the beach three blocks away and that's a fuckin’ escape. That's the lovely shit.”</p>

<p>But don't get it twisted, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> ain't some shook kid from the other side of the suburbs. Growing up, he did bids in <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="Manhattan">Manhattan</span> and like many inner-city youths became immersed in <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="hip-hop">hip-hop</span> culture. Graffiti bombin’ and listening to New York <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="rap">rap</span> radio shows were the activities of his teenage years, and along with his younger brother, DJ <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>, and <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Onyx">Onyx</span>, they formed the group <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span>.</p>

<p>Recorded on a friend's 4-track, their demo attracted the attention of <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="3rdBass">3rd Bass</span> MC <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Serch">Serch</span> and Pete Nice, and the trio was invited to record with the white wonders. Fresh off <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="GasFace">“The Gas Face,”</span> the fellas signed to <span id="#" class="mention-label" about="Elektra">Elektra</span> and released their 1991 debut, <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span>. An amalgamation of <span id="#" class="mention-organization" about="FivePercentNation">Five-Percenter</span> knowledge over uptempo soul-influenced tracks overflowing with cleverness, the LP's linchpin was the ingenious framework which held the songs together: a series of hilarious conversations between the band members and the stiff voice of the anonymous <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span>. Despite critical acclaim and the moderate success of the singles "Peachfuzz” and “Who Me?,” <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span> met with disappointing sales, sending the trio back to their lab to regroup.</p>

<p>Officially pared down to the duo of <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span> and <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>, <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> struck back at the world with a most astounding aesthetic realignment. Returning conspicuously more jaded for their sophomore effort (much like their tour-mates and <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="TheGodSquad">"God Squad"</span> compatriots, <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="BrandNubian">Brand Nubian</span>), the darker opus <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span> still managed to retain its wit. Beautifully constructed from deep bass grooves around a skeleton of vocal samples from original <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="LastPoets">Last Poet</span> <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="GylanKain">Gylan Kain</span>’s <span id="#" class="mention-sample" about="BlueGuerilla">Blue Guerilla</span> LP and filmmaker <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="MelvinVanPeebles">Melvin Van Peebles</span> epochal blaxploitation cinematic masterpiece, <span id="#" class="mention-sample" about="SweetSweetbacksBaadasssssSong">Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song</span>, <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="BlackBastards">Black Bastards</span> inventive edge was typified by its intro, <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="GarbageDay3">"Garbage Day 3."</span> An aural montage of snippets pertaining to the group's changing focus over an erratic bass line, the track’s brilliance was sustained through cuts like, <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="WhatANiggyKnow">“What A Nigga Know,”</span> <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="SweetPremium">“Sweet Premium,”</span> and <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="SweetPremium">“Black Bastards and Bitches.”</span></p>

<p>“With the second joint we really flipped the script,” says <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span>. “Like, ‘Okay, this is a real jewel night here.”</p>

<p>“There was always enlightenment,” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Onyx">Duce</span> adds, “but the second album was a warning.”</p>

<p>But shortly after completing this masterpiece, tragedy befell the group when Subroc was fatally struck by a car on the Island. Compounding the calamity was a “Cop Killer”-era controversy over *Black Bastards*’ Zev illustrated cover artwork that depicted their Sambo character symbol in a noose swinging from a tree: an incident that wound up getting the group dropped from their label. Yet despite the bleakness of that period, today <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> is able to maintain his perspective on the big picture: “Elektra spent loot to make the album, they gave us loot to step off the label and now we got the rights to the shit anyway. More than anything, time got lost.”</p>

<p>Having now adopted the identity of a “Super M.F. Villain” <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> is now ready to move on and has a full plate of upcoming releases including his third album, *The Super M.F. Villains*, and a collaborative release with M.F. Grimm and others called the *Monster Island Project*, which uses the themes of movie monsters like Godzilla, Jet Jaguar and Megalon.</p>

<p>“Tt’s all just evolution,” the illusionist says of his forthcoming works. “I’m-a just lay it down on some real hip hop shit. Fuck the distractions.”</p>

<p>Focused on his art, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span> is not wetting C.R.E.A.M. or fame, which is epitomized by his refusal to be photographed. “Super Villains get part of their power from muthafuckas not knowing who they are,” he reasons. “It’s music that we're selling—not my face.”</p>

<p>Besides his two LPs, probably the greatest gem that the Villain will finally bestow upon us is the proper release of *Black Bastards*—on wax on Bobbito Garcia's Fondle ‘Em label. It seems that finally the wrongs that have plagued Doom’s career have been obliterated.</p>

<p>A perpetually elusive master of masquerade, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="MFDoom">M.F. Doom</span>, the artist has returned to us in full form. And all we can say is—welcome back, muthafucka.</p>
