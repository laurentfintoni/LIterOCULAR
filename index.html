            <p class="lead">Hi! Thanks for visiting our website, two quick things:<br /><br />
              1. LiterOCULAR is intended as a reading framework with
              rich functionality and interesting design. Unfortunately, this means screens smaller than a medium-sized tablet won't work
              very well, so we inhibit access from
              these devices.<br /><br />
              2. Chrome is the best browser which to view the site, though it will also work in Firefox and
              Safari with some slight stylistic inconsistencies. No idea about Edge because, honestly, who cares?

            <h5>Issue and Article Selection</h5>
            <p>Source articles for the Death And Rebirth issue were taken from a personal archive of MF Doom features and interviews downloaded following his death in late 2020. Text was extracted using the pytesseract Python library, and then manually cleaned up, and images extracted via Photoshop.</p>
            <p>Source articles for Who Watches the Admen? were taken from online articles about the firing of AI researcher Timnit Gebru available at <em>MIT Review</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
            <p>The two issues were chosen for their historical and specific differences, as well as for their close relation to our field of study in Digital Humanities: archival in the case of MF Doom and ethics and representation in computer science and tech in the case of Gebru. Each article within these issues was chosen in order to give a range of perspective on the same theme, with some cross over between both in the case of more specific topics such as identity.</p>
            <p>Full details of every article's source can be found in the Disclaimer section of the magazine, while details of each issue's subject and theme can be found in the contents section and metadata viewer.</p>
            <h5>Text Formatting</h5>
            <p>The chosen articles were formatted for metadata extraction and reference including article-level metadata (source, byline, publication date) and topic-specific metadata. We chose to give all texts a common layout, where headers would have a <code>h1</code> tag and most of the article would be in <code>p</code> tags. We added figures and <code>blockquotes</code> as necessary to handle images and pull out quotes. We then dove into the articles themselves, reflecting on the content to decide what should be formatted with specific <code>span</code> tags for metadata usage.</p>
            <p>These <code>span</code> tags include ID attributes, which we ended up not using but have kept for potential future development, a class instance of <code>mention-*</code> where * would stand for the topic the fragment refers to, and an <code>about=”*”</code> attribute where * would refer to a specific entity within the topic. This system, which was implemented partly by hand and partly through regular expression matching, was designed to plug into the functionality requirements of the project.</p>
            <p>After a first round of formatting we had a set of topic classes for each issue (e.g. person, subject, organization etc...) which allowed us to evaluate the main themes of each, decide how to handle abstract topics, and decide on whether or not to merge / remove certain entities for clarity and focus. In the case of the Death And Rebirth issue we chose to not merge the two different aliases of the primary subject (Zev Love X and MF Doom), while for Who Watches the Admen? we decided to keep the gender, identity, and racism topics separate despite their close semantic relationship. In both cases we ultimately felt that there would be benefits in being able to view these closely connected topics together. The metadata viewer shows the primary topics for each issue based on this work.</p>
            <h5>Base Functionality, Design and Requirements</h5>
            <p>Not gonna lie, we spent a fair amount feeling like this while contemplating the spec for this project:<br/>
              <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="/img/maths.gif" class="img-fluid" style="align: center;" alt="animated image of the thinking equations meme" title="When the specs make you flip"></div>
            As a first step we built a virgin Bootstrap skeleton with two pages: the home page, which would act as both cover and contents of the digital magazine, and an issue page, within which all articles would be viewable. We then decided to use the following line from the spec as an overall guiding principle when approaching the underlying design of the magazine: "The canvas should be exactly as big as the viewport. Individual articles and metadata viewer will scroll autonomously within the overall canvas."

            LiterOCULAR is a digital magazine created for the Information Modeling and Web technologies course of the
            Master's Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, a/y 2020-21.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magazine is enhanced by metadata binoculars, which allow you to identify and compare various topics within the
            articles, and stylistic lenses, which allow you to change the design style of the magazine on the fly
            based on four distinct historical eras. You never knew you needed this stuff and to be fair until we were told
            to
            build it we didn't know either!
          </p>
          <p class="last">
            The first issue of LiterOCULAR, Death and Rebirth, features three articles that cover the metamophorsis of
            the late rapper
            Daniel Dumile AKA MF Doom following the death of his brother. The second issue, Who Watches the Admen?,
            focuses on the sudden
            departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru from Google in late 2020.
