              1. LiterOCULAR is intended as a reading framework with
              rich functionality and interesting design. Unfortunately, this means screens smaller than a medium-sized
              tablet won't work
              very well, so we prevent access from
              these devices.<br /><br />
              2. Chrome is the best browser which to view the site, though it will also work in Firefox and
              Safari with some slight stylistic inconsistencies. No idea about Edge because, honestly, who cares?

                    <p>Following the specifications for this project, the articles were formatted for metadata
                      extraction and reference at the article-level
                      (source, byline, publication date) and at the fragment-level with topic-specific metadata. We
                      chose to give the raw html for each article a
                      common layout: titles in <code>h1</code> tag, subheaders and bylines with their own specific
                      class, and the rest of the text in <code>p</code> tags. We added <code>figure</code> and
                      <code>blockquote</code> tags as necessary to handle images and pull out quotes. We also kept
                      external embeds when possible (a video in <em>The Washington Post</em> article was removed as it
                      went offline during development) and either left them in the text itself or put them in modals
                      when they couldn't easily be restyled due to using iframes. We also spent time reflecting on the
                      content to decide what
                      should be formatted with specific <code>span</code> tags for article- and fragment-level metadata
                      usage.

                    </figure>
                    <p>These <code>span</code> tags include ID attributes, which we ended up not using but have kept for
                      potential future development, a class instance of <code>mention-*</code>, where * would stand for
                      the topic the fragment refers to, and an <code>about=‚Äù*‚Äù</code> attribute, where * would refer to
                      a specific entity within the topic. This system, which was implemented partly by hand and partly
                      through regular expression matching, was designed to then plug into the dynamic functionality
                      requirements of the project: the classes would allow for population of article-level topics (e.g.
                      technology) while the attribute would allow for population of specific instances of the topic
                      (e.g. Artifical Intelligence).</p>
                    <p>After a first round of formatting we had a set of article-level topics for each issue (e.g.
                      person,
                      subject, organization etc...) which allowed us to evaluate the main themes, decide how to handle
                      abstract topics, and decide on whether or not to merge / remove certain entities for clarity and
                      focus. In the end we felt that there would be benefits in being able to view closely connected
                      topics (such as the different aliases of Daniel Dumile) alongside each other and so decided
                      against merging entities.</p>

                    <p>Not gonna lie, we spent a fair amount of time feeling like this while contemplating the
                      functionality requirements for
                      this project:<br />
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 0.625vw;"><img

                        alt="animated image of the thinking equations meme" title="When the specs make you think"></div>
                    As a first step we built a virgin Bootstrap 5 skeleton with two pages: the home page, which would
                    act as both cover and table of contents for the digital magazine, and an issue page, within which
                    all articles
                    would be viewable inside columns. We also included a static navbar to enable navigation back and
                    forth as well as access to the metadata viewer and CSS themes. Towards the end of development we
                    also decided to adjust the navbar so that it would be partial on the cover (with access to the
                    about, documentation, and disclaimer pages and showing the metadata viewer as yet unavailable)
                    because access to issues and lenses are available on page in the ToC.</p>
                    <p>Early on we decided to use the following line from the
                      spec as an overall guiding principle when approaching the underlying design of the
                      magazine: "The canvas should be exactly as big as the viewport. Individual articles and
                      metadata viewer will scroll autonomously within the overall canvas."</p>
                    <p>As a result we locked the canvas of both pages to viewport dimensions and then spent some time
                      deciding the best approach for the metadata viewer, finally settling on using Bootstrap's
                      offcanvas functionality and placing the viewer on the bottom half of the screen with a height of
                      85 to enable us to have as much space within it as possible. This choice did end up affecting
                      another part of the spec, namely our ability to enable clicking on a fragment within the metadata
                      viewer to auto scroll to its position within the article. As the articles are partially covered by
                      the offcanvas while browsing the metadata viewer this would have required a fair amount of hoop
                      jumping via scripts that we felt was too complicated and with too many variables for a smooth user
                      experience. Furthermore, due to most topic fragments
                      having multiple instances, auto scroll to first instance with the viewer retracted felt somewhat
                      pointless as the user would then have no way to continue flipping through each topic instance.
                    <p>
                    <p>We justify this choice, as
                      well as others detailed in this documentation by referring to another part of the spec which we
                      also used as a guiding principle: "design deliberately."</p>
                    <p>The home page was laid out with a fluid container to tap into the viewport logic governing the
                      project (see below for more detail on this). This container was then split into two columns: the
                      left one acting as the cover / editor's letter and the right one acting as a ToC. They were
                      proportioned to emphasise the cover and their columns were set to medium breakpoint to ensure
                      consistency across all supported device sizes (see below for more on that). The ToC uses gutters
                      and margins of <code>0.5rem</code>. The issue page is essentially a navbar and three columns split
                      equally across the Bootstrap grid, with <code>0.5rem</code> of padding on the containing row to
                      ensure that functionality, design, and legibility aren't compromised.</p>
                    <p>The decision to adhere to the canvas lock also led us to decide that no part of the magazine
                      should be scrollable aside from the articles themselves (using the CSS <code>overflow</code>
                      property with scrollbar hidden by default) and the modals. In essence, we made the
                      design decision that this magazine would be constrained in a similar way as print magazines were
                      by their choice of paper size. Therefore we made all additional page requirements (disclaimer,
                      about, documentation) modals and designed the cover/content page to fit within the viewport at all
                      available sizes (see below).</p>
                    <figure style="float: left; width: 30%; padding: 0.625vw 0.625vw 0 0.625vw; margin-bottom: 0;">
                      <img src="/LiterOCULAR/img/res1.png" class="img-fluid"
                        alt="screenshot of base relative unit scaling" title="4K res without vw">
                      <figcaption style="float: left;">4K/2560x1357 res without vw</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>One last but important note regards typometry and the baseline measurement of
                      every element in this magazine. We started designing LiterOCULAR using <code>rem</code> as the
                      base relative unit, for two reasons: it is the unit used by Bootstrap's core css, and <a
                        href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/" target="_blank">it
                        simplifies nesting declarations</a>. However, once we'd gotten deeper into the various
                      historical designs we made the decision to switch our base relative unit to <code>vw</code>. This
                      was due to the fact that when viewing the magazine on higher resolution screens, Bootstrap's
                      framework can lead to an overall shrinking/stretching of the design within the canvas (see
                      screenshots).</p>
                    <figure style="float: right; width: 30%; padding: 0.625vw 0.625vw 0 0.625vw; margin-bottom: 0;">
                      <img src="/LiterOCULAR/img/res2.png" class="img-fluid"
                        alt="screenshot of base relative unit scaling" title="4K res without vw">
                      <figcaption>4K/2560x1357 res with vw</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>While experimenting with some design ideas we realised that by changing all the necessary base
                      relative units in our css as well as overiding key elements in the core css we could have a design
                      that scaled relative to screen resolution. As there is no such thing as a clean answer in web dev
                      ‚Äî üòÜ ‚Äî we then realised that this approach meant that once you went below a tablet in device size
                      you encountered the opposite problem: the device's smaller width lead to everything being
                      relatively too small to be readable or usable.
                      One option to get around this would have been to script a calculation function to change the base
                      relative unit in the css based on device so that anything below 768 would revert to px or rem and
                      anything above the most common resolutions for desktop and laptop used vw. As the decision to
                      switch to vw was made relatively late in the development process (keeping it üíØ it was Laurent who
                      made that decision in a CSS-induced fever and
                      essentially put Federico in front of it as an accomplished fact ü§´), by which point we already had
                      a
                      lot of scripts already implemented, we decided to instead block access to the site for any devices
                      below 768. Furthermore anything smaller than a tablet makes the experience of content-focused
                      interactive sites such as this difficult without a full rethinking of the layout. Again, we
                      justify these decisions by
                      invoking the "design deliberately" principle.</p>

                      the best way to approach its requirements. In the end we settled on a design for the viewer
                      that imitates that of the issue page: three columns. The offcanvas is separated into three
                      rows: header with title and controls; issue-level metadata and usage instructions;
                      and article-level metadata. The latter is in turn split into three columns containing a series of
                      accordions populated by the article's topics (titled using the <code>mention-*</code> class). Each
                      accordion gives the user access to all topic instances (titled using the <code>about=‚Äù*‚Äù</code>
                      attribute), and selecting a topic instance will highlight it across the article. Lastly, each
                      topic instance auto-generates a Wikipedia search via a split button. Both the accordions and
                      topics within are presented in descending order of density within the article. A reset button
                      enables the user to remove their chosen highlights and start again.</p>

                      with the primary purpose of a magazine: reading.</p>

                      then
                      the design requirements of creating four different historical CSS themes left us feeling like
                      Dawson.
                      Still the only choice was to embrace the pain and let it make us stronger, like Vegeta.</p>
                    <p>Based on the requirements we decided on the following four themes:<br />
                    <ul>
                      <li>19th century: Newspapers</li>
                      <li>1900-1950: Art Deco</li>
                      <li>Late 20th century print: 1990s hip-hop magazines</li>
                      <li>2030s: Promptism</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each theme was given an appropriate title. While Newspaper and Art Deco were self-evident, the name
                    for the 1990s hip-hop magazines theme was taken from the publication used as direct reference for
                    the
                    theme, <em>The Source</em>, and the name for the Promptism theme was taken from one of the <a
                      href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index" target="_blank">key libraries</a> used in
                    Machine Learning today, huggingface's transformers.</p>
                    <p>Having created a core css to handle the rules that would be needed regardless of stylistic theme
                      (such as canvas lock, offcanvas positioning, switching animation etc...) we then created each
                      individual theme
                      separately and built a functionality that would load a base theme by default and substitute it for
                      the relevant historical one when selected via the ToC or navbar menus. We also made the choice
                      to use a simple CSS animation, featuring the three primary colors of the base theme, to hide this
                      switch and make the user experience more pleasant.</p>
                    <p>As with all other main steps of the development of this project, CSS theming was an iterative
                      process. We began with a base theme, then created initial versions of both the Promptism and
                      Newspaper themes. However, it was during the creation of the Source theme that we refined and
                      improved our approach and made several decisions that were then rolled out to all other themes
                      ensuring a consistency that reflects the relevant historical periods without creating drastic
                      changes on the content. This decision was a by-product of a last key guiding principle we had
                      settled on: the content should the focus of this
                      magazine with the design requirements a complement to it.</p>
                    <p>The decisions that were made at this point and further refined in each theme include: switching
                      to <code>vw</code> as the base relative unit, splitting
                      the navbar contents between both pages, using the navbar brand as a home button with its own
                      specific font, applying
                      consistent and historically inspired styles to computer interactions (such as hover and focus),
                      replicating historically accurate layout touches, and consistent usage of a selection of fonts and
                      colors for each theme.</p>
                    <p>With regards to fonts, dropcaps, indents, and padding sizes around text and images these were
                      drawn from our historical references and replicated using visual estimation in the spirit of the
                      spec's requirement to update historical elements. Dropcaps were eyeballed using sentence heights
                      and indents using letter length. While dropcap heights did vary historically, we found that the
                      indent length was roughly the same across all three themes that use it and so kept it the same.
                      All fonts are taken from GoogleFonts aside from three in the Newspaper theme. This is due to some
                      issues we were having with loading local fonts outside the Newspaper theme, and so decided to pick
                      up the challenge of finding everything we needed solely in their collection.</p>
                    <p>The entire CSS process is best summed by another two memes (like all good things in life):
                      procrastination and bug squashing.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> The base theme was first thought of
                      as a take on the greyscale aesthetic of current website design. In particular <a
                        href="https://widman.ski/" target="_blank">this site</a> was used as an early point of reference
                      following some research. The idea was that by keeping the base theme simple it would contrast
                      nicely with the historical themes. Eventually this approach was rethought as the Promptism theme
                      adopted a black background with white text and the Newspaper theme had potential for greyscale. In
                      the end we kept the white/black balance (#111 and
                      #f4f4f4) and desire for mininalism but ditched the original use of greys as spot colors and
                      instead used a cherry red highlight (#D2042D) that offered a perfect contrast. Inspired in part by
                      the way in which modern sites make use of emojis to enliven navigation and reading, we decided to
                      add them to article headers, byline, and cover/ToC as a visual cue signifying the theme's location
                      in
                      the current moment.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> Roboto Slab was chosen as an ideal header
                      font that would complement a sans-serif body font like Lato, which has a self-effacing simplicity.
                      Another option for the body would have been to use Roboto but we wanted to try something a little
                      different. Ubunto Mono was chosen for its contemporary style and the way in which its fixed-width
                      would contrast with the other fonts.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> The idea was to keep the layout simple
                      so as not to distract from the historical themes while offering a sense of playfulness that would
                      invite the user to delve into the site's wider functionality and purpose. We repurposed
                      Bootstrap's inbuilt functionalities, such as cards on the homepage mimicking buttons. We also
                      decided to align headers, subs, and bylines to the right for a simple contrast with the other
                      themes.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> For the Newspaper-inspired theme we
                      turned to Guilty Novin's exhaustive article for inspiration as well as a <a
                        href="https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?dates=1800-1899" target="_blank">collection of 19th
                        century newspapers</a> from the USA available at the Library of Congress. The typical layout of
                      newspapers of the time was already preserved with our use of columns for the magazine skeleton and
                      we focused on picking up some of the quirks and details of the time (an approach that was repeated
                      for all historical themes). While we originally thought that this theme would make use of
                      dropcaps, upon closer inspection of the LoC collection we noticed dropcaps only appeared to be
                      used for classified adverts rather than articles themselves. For the color palette, we settled on
                      a yellow-ish gray for the background (#ebe7dd) and a slightly toned-down black (#111) and white
                      (#f4f4f4) for text, in order to maintain high contrast and legibility. A light shade of yellow
                      (#f9eac8), a dark gray (#353434), and a dark shade of pink-red (#4a1520) were chosen as spot
                      colors for drop down menus, buttons, and highlights. Images were greyscaled via CSS filter to
                      align them with the overall historical feel.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> The easiest font to choose was the
                      magazine header/title font, <em>Chomsky</em>: it looks just like 19th century newspaper titles.
                      Next, we needed to find a fitting font for both body and headings: after unsuccessfully browsing
                      multiple sources while comparing typefaces with our historical sources, we stumbled upon a font
                      called <em>Old Newspaper Type</em>. It was freely available and in open format, and the deed was
                      quickly done. The search for a heading font was a multi-step process: we initially used Chunkfive
                      for both menus and textual headings, but quickly realized it wasn't historically accurate for
                      article content. We opted for keeping Chunkfive as an <em>extension</em> of the theme in menus and
                      interactive components, which clearly didn't exist at the time, and to use a more plain-looking
                      typeface called Newsreader for article headings. This is also the only font for the newspaper
                      theme found in GoogleFonts.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> Bottom margins were removed from
                      <code>p</code> tags, margins and padding were adjusted elsewhere (images, titles, menus etc...),
                      and text alignment was set to justified to emulate the condensed feel of the layouts of the time
                      as well as some their peculiar distortions. Solid, light lines were used to emulate the
                      demarcations and boxing of the time while a pointing hand was repurposed via Photoshop from <a

                      of the time made use of icons to enliven their layout and draw attention. Lastly, rounded edges
                      were removed from all boxes as they were not historically accurate.

                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> We chose Art Deco as it is an early
                      20th century style more readily associated with architecture and material design than print, which
                      we felt would be more interesting. After some research we honed in on two options: the more
                      flamboyant aesthetic typical of posters of the era or the more subdued but still striking
                      aesthetic of key print publications, namely <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> from NYC and <em>Arts &amp;
                        D&#233;coration</em> from Paris. We chose the second as more realistic to achieve. Time wise we
                      pulled from the first half of the Art Deco movement, before WWI, with references to a 1925 issue
                      of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> and a 1921 issue of <em>Arts &amp; D&#233;coration</em>, taken from
                      the Internet Archive via <a
                        href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=artsanddecoration"
                        target="_blank">The Online Books Page resource</a>.</p>
                    <p>We chose to focus the colors on a simple palette. Black (#111) and white (#fff) for background
                      and text, largely due to the fact that we already made use of a yellow shade for the Newspaper
                      theme to imitate old paper and we were unable to ascertain the exact page color from the scans.
                      White seemed a likely historically accurate choice, with color primarily kept for covers. A dark
                      shade of magenta-pink (#6F1946) and a shade of green (#68A469) were used as complimentary colors,
                      inspired by a <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> 1922 cover. The magenta-pink allowed for an interesting
                      twist on background color for menus and metadata viewer while the green as a spot color was a nice
                      reference to jade, one of the natural materials used in Art Deco designs such as jewelry
                      and furniture.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> Limelight was an obvious choice for the
                      branding, with its high contrast, geometric style instantly evoking our current understanding of
                      the era. Likewise, Poiret One was chosen as another cursive, sans-serif font that easily evokes
                      the era and would be better suited to titling so as not to have titles become overbearing. Prata
                      was chosen for the body as it emulated the contrast between curves and serifs seen in our
                      reference magazines. After trying out Poiret One but finding it too light, we opted for Cormorant
                      Garamond as the menu type. It felt like a good emulation of some of the title fonts in our
                      references and also has direct historical relationship to the 1920s as it is an open-source
                      adaption of Garamond which itself saw a revival during that period.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> One of the key layout elements we wanted
                      to emulate from our references was the use of geometric figures and embellishments as borders and
                      dividers. After doing some testing with images of historically accurate separators we opted to
                      instead make use of CSS pseudo-elements as these can more easily scale. We stumbled on two useful
                      bits of public code: a <a href="https://codepen.io/thewildmage/pen/ayewQw"
                        target="_blank">Codepen</a> with various Art Deco inspired separators, and a <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65758024/art-deco-style-border-in-css"
                        target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> thread with a simple double border frame. The latter was used
                      for the ToC and the former to embellish the cover title and blockquotes with corners, diamond
                      separators, and full frames. Returning to our references, we opted for double solid lines to frame
                      the cover images of each article, with additional padding on the images themselves to emphasize
                      the frame.</p>
                    <p>Based on our references, we centered headers, subheaders, bylines, and captions and added italics
                      to subheaders and captions and uppercase to bylines. Dropcaps were added to the beginning of each
                      article, followed by indents, both using pseudo-elements to control all the necessary instances
                      across the six articles (and modals) using <code>*nth-child</code> logic. Due to the differences
                      in some of the html
                      structures of the articles, we also had to create additional classes to ensure that dropcaps
                      and indents behaved correctly across both issues (this was in turn taken across to other themes).
                      The remaining
                      letters of the first word of each line were also uppercased following a dropcap as was the norm.
                      Bottom margin
                      was removed from paragraphs, and padding was kept around images in line with historical
                      references. We only kept rounded edges on the top corners of boxes (buttons, modals etc...) as
                      based on our references that appeared
                      like the most accurate use of rounded edges at the time. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> The choice of 1990s hip-hop
                      magazines for this theme was clear from the beginning, as the articles of the Death And Rebirth
                      issue were taken from issues of <em>The Source</em> and <em>Ego Trip Magazine</em>, two key US
                      publications for fans of the music at the time. With access to a large personal collection of
                      scans from publications of the time (<em>XXL</em>, <em>Rap Pages</em>, and <em>Hip-Hop
                        Connection</em> among others) we first began to look for key aesthetic elements common to this
                      subset of music magazines. While each of these publications had a certain style,
                      there was an undeniable common aesthetic to hip-hop magazines of the time and we originally
                      considered making direct references to different publications before ultimately deciding that
                      <em>The Source</em> would be the direct reference, essentially speaking for all. Part of the
                      reason for this was that we had access to many different <em>Source</em> articles as reference,
                      compared with other magazines, and that it is historically one of the most important publications
                      of this specific subset.
                    </p>
                    <p>For our primary palette we decided on a very light shade of orange (#e1dcd8) as the main
                      background color and a medium shade (#DBBC9F) for the metada viewer, modals, and buttons. This
                      choice was inspired by some of the specific backgrounds in our reference documents, in particular
                      a fact box that became the basis for the theme's boxes. Text used a
                      very dark shade of blue-magenta (#222125) extracted from scans, which was also used for the navbar
                      in the spirit of how content pages and regular columns were presented. For primary spot colors we
                      used a shade of red (#d5473b) which was a common balance to the black in many issues as well as
                      magenta (#70557D) and pink (#8c485f) for borders and highlights. The articles themselves feature
                      additional color combinations in the titles, which was inspired by the way in which 1990s music
                      magazines often called on a wide range of color combinations with each article often featuring its
                      own specific palette.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> After trying to analyse fonts used at the
                      time and doing some research we settled on a combination that we think evokes the spirit of the
                      times. Alfa Slab One was chosen for branding and titling as an old-style serif with a strong
                      visual effect that brings to mind some of the title fonts used by <em>The Source</em> in its early
                      days. Oswald was chosen as a clean gothic sans-serif ideal for blockquotes and dropcaps, evoking
                      some of the extra bold sans-serif used at the time. Glegoo felt ideal for menus with its lighter
                      slab
                      serif evoking print in very clear ways. Lastly, Libre Baskerville was chosen for the body, as
                      serifs tended to be common in body text at the time (though there was a switch to sans-serif in
                      the decade) and it is optimised for body usage on computers. </p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> The aim with the layout of this theme
                      was to try and capture how diverse the design of each article in <em>The Source</em> could often
                      be. Common
                      elements were chosen to tie it together, especially as we didn't have the luxury of multiple
                      pages: the use of uppercase for bylines and menus; straight corners; no background hover colors;
                      the use of a small black square to indicate the end of an
                      article. After this we opted to recreate the layouts of the three different articles in Death And
                      Rebirth as these were most directly related to our magazine. Each article has therefore been as
                      closely recreated as possible, with the 1991 <em>Source</em> article about KMD featuring a
                      different, but historically accurate, lead photo to allow us to recreate the title's positioning.
                      For the second issue, we drew from the color combination and design styles of Source articles from
                      1991 and 1992 including the use of image cropping (recreated via CSS <code>clip-path</code>
                      property thanks to this <a href="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/" target="_blank">handy
                        resource</a>), line boxing around titles, and color alternation. Subheaders within article were
                      also styled in homage of the times with solid background colors, center alignment and small
                      dropcaps and letter spacing to control their stretching across the available space. Lastly, bottom
                      margins were removed from paragraphs, an
                      underline given to bylines, and text justified.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4vw;">Promptism is a movement
                      rooted in the technological advances of the 21st century that holds the potential to completely
                      transform artistic practices. Promptism was founded in response to the growing concern that
                      traditional art had become irrelevant to the modern world. Going beyond painting and sculpture,
                      Promptist art involves the manipulation of new media, specifically computer generated imagery,
                      animation, and the Internet. Its unique dynamism makes Promptism a dynamic vehicle for the
                      expression of identity and the implementation of real-time feedback between itself and the
                      spectator.</blockquote>

                    </figcaption>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> For our last trick we gave some
                      serious thought to how best to approach the spec's requirement that one of the themes be an
                      imagination of what the future of design might look like. Keeping it üíØ we're not fans of
                      predictions,
                      they just always seem so forced and rarely hit the spot (unless we're talking about speculative
                      fiction but let's not go there because it's too depressing). One early idea was to mint an NFT and
                      just make the entire website redirect to a blockchain entry, but we didn't have the money to be
                      honest and it felt like too much of a cop out (still think it's funny in a conceptual art kinda
                      way). Eventually we
                      decided that it would be just as fun to use the current Promptist movement and advances in Machine
                      Learning to generate most of the CSS code via prompts given to a GPT model: <a
                        href="https://6b.eleuther.ai/" target="_blank">Eleuther AI's GPT-J-6B</a>.</p>
                    <p>That's right, all of the CSS in this theme was generated from prompts with the model's
                      suggestions refined and aligned to ensure the result wasn't too chaotic. The color scheme and
                      fonts were picked from simple prompts of partial Google Fonts URLs and CSS properties and then we
                      fed it the selectors we needed based on the default theme and continued along until we had
                      something workable.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we also generated new versions of all the images in our magazine using VGAN+CLIP <a
                        href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_4Jl0a7WIJeqy5LTjPJfZOwMZopG5C-W"

                        href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nWkU3HlGBF5Gl_XjWs_k-QIDDB18nDpK"
                        target="_blank">notebooks</a>. The cover images were generated based on source image and title
                      as prompt using the CLIP Guided Diffusion approach by Katherine Crowson, while article images were
                      generated with source image and title as prompt using standard VGAN+CLIP models.</p>
                    <p>The original idea was to have the entire site be generated by prompts, including the text, and we
                      actually did generate alternate versions of each article but in the end finding a way to cleanly
                      subsitute everything proved too demanding so we settled for simply swapping the images using
                      Javascript.</p>
                    <p>While this theme started as a bit of a joke and pushback against the spec requirements, we do
                      think that Promptism, as the current movement of machine-enabled art has been coined by some,
                      offers a genuinely interesting take on what the future of art and content will look like. The
                      Promptist Manifesto, written by GPT-3, can be read <a

              It's a question we asked ourselves repeatedly during the process of completing this project. Sometimes
              the doing is the answer.

            Since 2021, LiterOCULAR has been the destination for inquisitive minds who want to go beyond merely reading an article and instead use an intricate interface to dive into its metatextual meaning while also killing time by switching between historical design styles. 
          </p>
          <p>
            How does LiterOCULAR do this? Well, the magazine is enhanced by metadata binoculars, which allow you to identify and compare various topics within articles, and stylistic lenses, which allow you to change the design style of the magazine on the fly
            based on four distinct historical eras. You never knew you needed this stuff and to be fair until we were
            told to build it we didn't know either!
          </p>
          <p class="last">
            The first issue of LiterOCULAR, Death and Rebirth, details the metamophorsis of
            the late rapper Daniel Dumile AKA MF Doom following the death of his brother. The second issue, Who Watches the Admen?,
            focuses on the sudden departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru from Google in late 2020. More issues are planned for 2022, we just need to figure out how to get some money first.
