              1. LiterOCULAR is intended as a reading framework with
              rich functionality and interesting design. Unfortunately, this means screens smaller than a medium-sized
              tablet won't work
              very well, so we prevent access from
              these devices.<br /><br />
              2. Chrome is the best browser which to view the site, though it will also work in Firefox and
              Safari with some slight stylistic inconsistencies. No idea about Edge because, honestly, who cares?

                      features and interviews downloaded following his death in late 2020. Text was extracted using the

                      for their close relation to our personal interests and field of study in the Digital Humanities:
                      hip-hop culture and archival in the case of Death And Rebirth, and ethics and representation in
                      computer science and tech in the case of Who Watches the Admen?. Each article within these issues
                      was chosen to give a range of perspective on the same subject (Dumile's artistic reinvention,
                      Gebru's firing from Google), with some cross over between both in the case of more specific topics

                      (source, byline, publication date) and topic-specific metadata. We chose to give all texts a
                      common layout, where headers would have a <code>h1</code> tag, subs and bylines their own specific
                      class, and the rest of the text would be in <code>p</code> tags. We added <code>figure</code> and
                      <code>blockquote</code> tags as necessary to handle images and pull out quotes. We also kept
                      external embeds when possible (a video in <em>The Washington Post</em> article was removed as it
                      went offline during development) and either left them in the text itself or put them in modals
                      when they couldn't easily be restyled. We also spent time reflecting on the content to decide what
                      should be formatted with specific <code>span</code> tags for metadata usage.

                    <p>These <code>span</code> tags include ID attributes, which we ended up not using but have kept for
                      potential future development, a class instance of <code>mention-*</code>, where * would stand for
                      the topic the fragment refers to, and an <code>about=‚Äù*‚Äù</code> attribute, where * would refer to
                      a specific entity within the topic. This system, which was implemented partly by hand and partly
                      through regular expression matching, was designed to then plug into the dynamic functionality
                      requirements of the project.</p>
                    <p>After a first round of formatting we had a set of topic classes for each issue (e.g. person,
                      subject, organization etc...) which allowed us to evaluate the main themes, decide how to handle
                      abstract topics, and decide on whether or not to merge / remove certain entities for clarity and
                      focus. In the end we felt that there would be benefits in being able to view closely connected
                      topics alongside each other and so decided against merging entities. The metadata viewer shows the
                      primary topics for each issue based on this work.</p>

                    <p>Not gonna lie, we spent a fair amount of time feeling like this while contemplating the spec for
                      this project:<br />
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 0.625vw;"><img
                        src="/LiterOCULAR/img/maths.gif" class="img-fluid"
                        alt="animated image of the thinking equations meme" title="When the specs make you think"></div>
                    As a first step we built a virgin Bootstrap 5 skeleton with two pages: the home page, which would
                    act as both cover and ToC page of the digital magazine, and an issue page, within which all articles
                    would be viewable inside columns. We also included a static navbar to enable navigation back and
                    forth as well as access to the metadata viewer and CSS themes. Towards the end of development we
                    also decided to adjust the navbar so that it would be partial on the cover (with access to the
                    about, documentation, and disclaimer pages and showing the metadata viewer as yet unavailable)
                    because access to issues and lenses are available on page in the table of contents.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early on we decided to use the following line from the
                        spec as an overall guiding principle when approaching the underlying design of the
                        magazine</span>: "The canvas should be exactly as big as the viewport. Individual articles and
                      metadata viewer will scroll autonomously within the overall canvas."</p>
                    <p>As a result we locked the canvas of both pages to viewport dimensions and then spent some time
                      deciding the best approach for the metadata viewer, finally settling on using Bootstrap's
                      offcanvas functionality and placing the viewer on the bottom half of the screen with a height of
                      85 to enable us to have as much space within it as possible. This choice did end up affecting
                      another part of the spec, namely our ability to enable clicking on a fragment within the metadata
                      viewer to auto scroll to its position within the article. As the articles are partially covered by
                      the offcanvas while browsing the metadata viewer this would have required a fair amount of hoop
                      jumping via scripts that we felt was too complicated. Furthermore, due to most topic fragments
                      having multiple instances, auto scroll to first instance felt somewhat redundant from a user
                      experience point of view. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We justify this choice, as
                        well as others detailed in this documentation by referring to another part of the spec which we
                        also used as a guiding principle: "design deliberately."</span></p>
                    <p>The decision to adhere to the canvas lock also led us to decide that no part of the magazine
                      should be scrollable aside from the articles themselves and the modals. In essence, we made the
                      design decision that this magazine would be constrained in a similar way as print magazines were
                      by their choice of paper size. Therefore we made all additional page requirements (disclaimer,
                      about, documentation) modals and designed the cover/content page to fit within the viewport at all
                      available sizes (see below).</p>
                    <figure style="float: left; width: 30%; padding: 0.625vw 0.625vw 0 0.625vw; margin-bottom: 0;">
                      <img src="/LiterOCULAR/img/res1.png" class="img-fluid"

                      <figcaption style="float: left;">4K/2560x1357 res without vw</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>One last but important note on this subject regards typometry and the baseline measurement of
                      every element in this magazine. We started designing LiterOCULAR using <code>rem</code> as the
                      base relative unit, for two reasons: it is the unit used by Bootstrap's core css, and <a
                        href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/" target="_blank">it
                        simplifies nesting declarations</a>. However, once we'd gotten deeper into the various
                      historical designs we made the decision to switch our base relative unit to <code>vw</code>. This
                      was due to the fact that when viewing the magazine on higher resolution screens, Bootstrap's
                      framework can lead to an overall shrinking/stretching of the design within the canvas.</p>
                    <figure style="float: right; width: 30%; padding: 0.625vw 0.625vw 0 0.625vw; margin-bottom: 0;">

                    <p>While experimenting with some design ideas we realised that by changing all the necessary base
                      relative units in our css as well as overiding key elements in the core css we could have a design
                      that scaled relative to screen resolution. As there is no such thing as a clean answer in web dev
                      ‚Äî üòÜ ‚Äî we then realised that this approach meant that once you went below a tablet in device size
                      you encountered the opposite problem: everything was scaled too small to be pleasant and usable.
                      One option to get around this would have been to script a calculation function to change the base
                      relative unit in the css based on device so that anything below 768 would revert to px or rem and
                      anything above the most common resolutions for desktop and laptop used vw. As the decision to
                      switch to vw was made relatively late in the development process, by which point we already had a
                      lot of scripts already implemented, we decided to instead block access to the site for any devices
                      below 768 (keeping it üíØ it was Laurent who made that decision in a CSS-induced fever and
                      essentially put Federico in front of it as an accomplished fact ü§´). Again, we justify this by
                      invoking the "design deliberately" principle.</p>

                      that imitates that of the issue page: three columns. In turn the viewer is separated into three
                      horizontal sections: header with title and controls, issue-level metadata and usage instructions,
                      and article-level metadata. In turn, the latter is split into accordions based on subject (drawn

                    <p>If the functionality requirements of the spec left us feeling like thinking equations meme, then
                      the design requirements of creating 4 different historical CSS themes left us feeling like Dawson.
                      Still the only choice was to embrace the pain and let it make us stronger, like Vegeta.</p>
                    <p>Based on the spec we decided on the following 4 historical themes:<br />
                    <ul>
                      <li>Newspapers for the 19th century</li>
                      <li>Art Deco for the first half of the 20th century</li>
                      <li>Hip-hop magazines for late 20th century print</li>
                      <li>Promptism for 2030s</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each theme was given an appropriate title. While newspapers and Art Deco are self-evident, the name
                    for the 1990s music magazines theme was taken from the publication used as direct reference for the
                    theme, <em>The Source</em>, while the name for the Promptist theme was taken from one of the <a
                      href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index" target="_blank">key libraries</a> used in
                    Machine Learning today, huggingface's transformers.</p>
                    <p>Having created a core css to handle the rules that would be needed regardless of stylistic theme
                      (such as canvas lock, offcanvas positioning, etc...) we then created each individual theme
                      separately and built a functionality that would load a base theme by default and substitute it for
                      the relevant historical one when selected via the cover or navbar menus. We also made the choice
                      to use a simple CSS animation, featuring the three primary colors of the base theme, to hide this
                      switch and make the user experience more pleasant.</p>
                    <p>As with all other main steps of the development of this project, CSS theming was an iterative
                      process. We began with a base theme, then created initial versions of both the Promptism and
                      Newspaper themes. However, it was during the creation of the Source theme that we refined and
                      improved our approach and made several decisions that were then rolled out to all other themes
                      ensuring a consistency that reflects the relevant historical periods without creating drastic
                      changes on the content. This decision was a by-product of a last key guiding principle we had
                      settled on: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the content should the focus of this
                        magazine with the design requirements a complement to it</span>.</p>
                    <p>The decisions that were made at this point and further refined in each theme include: splitting
                      the navbar contents between both pages, using the navbar brand as a home button with its own
                      specific font, laying out the home page with two columns to enable on-page navigation, applying
                      consistent and historically inspired styles to modern interactions (such as hover and focus),
                      replicating historically accurate layout touches, and consistent usage of a selection of fonts and
                      colors for each theme.</p>
                    <p>The entire CSS process is best summed by another two memes (like all good things in life):
                      procrastination and bug squashing.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> The base theme was first thought of
                      as a take on the greyscale aesthetic of current website design. In particular <a
                        href="https://widman.ski/" target="_blank">this site</a> was used as an early point of reference
                      following some research. The idea was that by keeping the base theme simple it would contrast
                      nicely with the historical themes. Eventually this approach was rethought as the Promptism theme
                      adopted a black background with white text and the Newspaper theme had potential for greyscale
                      (though this was also later avoided). In the end we kept the white/black balance (#111 and
                      #f4f4f4) and desire for mininalism but ditched the original use of greys as spot colors and
                      instead used a cherry red highlight (#D2042D) that offered a perfect contrast. Inspired in part by
                      the way in which modern sites make use of emojis to enliven navigation and reading, we decided to
                      add them to article headers, byline, and cover as a visual cue signifying the theme's location in
                      the current moment.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> Roboto Slab was chosen as an ideal header
                      font that would complement a sans-serif body font like Lato, which has a self-effacing simplicity.
                      Another option for the body would have been to use Roboto but we wanted to try something a little
                      different. Ubunto Mono was chosen for its contemporary style and the way in which its fixed-width
                      would contrast with the other fonts.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> The idea was to keep the layout simple
                      so as not to distract from the historical themes while offering a sense of playfulness that would
                      invite the user to delve into the site's wider functionality and purpose. We repurposed
                      Bootstrap's inbuilt functionalities, such as cards on the homepage mimicking buttons. We also
                      decided to align headers, subs, and bylines to the right for a simple contrast with the other
                      themes.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> For the Newspaper-inspired theme we
                      turned to Guilty Novin's exhaustive article for inspiration as well as a <a
                        href="https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?dates=1800-1899" target="_blank">collection of 19th
                        century newspapers</a> from the USA available at the Library of Congress. The typical layout of
                      newspapers of the time was already preserved with our use of columns for the magazine skeleton and
                      we focused on picking up some of the quirks and details of the time (an approach that was repeated
                      for all historical themes). While we originally thought that this theme would make use of
                      dropcaps, upon closer inspection of the LoC collection we noticed dropcaps only appeared to be
                      used for classified adverts rather than articles themselves. For the color palette, we settled on
                      a yellow-ish gray for the background (#ebe7dd) and a slightly toned-down black (#111) and white
                      (#f4f4f4) for text, in order to maintain high contrast and legibility. A light shade of yellow
                      (#f9eac8), a dark gray (#353434), and a dark shade of pink-red (#4a1520) were chosen as spot
                      colors for drop down menus, buttons, and highlights. Images were greyscaled via CSS filter to
                      align them with the overall historical feel. TK d7ccc1 (viewer / modal background color?)</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> The easiest font to choose was the
                      magazine header/title font, <em>Chomsky</em>: it looks just like 19th century newspaper titles.
                      Next, we needed to find a fitting font for both body and headings: after unsuccessfully browsing
                      multiple sources while comparing typefaces with our historical sources, we stumbled upon a font
                      called <em>Old Newspaper Type</em>. It was freely available and in open format, and the deed was
                      quickly done. The search for a heading font was a multi-step process: we initially used Chunkfive
                      for both menus and textual headings, but quickly realized it wasn't historically accurate for
                      article content. We opted for keeping Chunkfive as an <em>extension</em> of the theme in menus and
                      interactive components, which clearly didn't exist at the time, and to use a more plain-looking
                      typeface called Newsreader for article headings. This is also the only font for the newspaper
                      theme found in GoogleFonts.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> Bottom margins were removed from
                      <code>p</code> tags, margins and padding were adjusted elsewhere (images, titles, menus etc...),
                      and text alignment was set to justified to emulate the condensed feel of the layouts of the time
                      as well as some their peculiar distortions. Solid, light lines were used to emulate the
                      demarcations and boxing of the time while a pointing hand was repurposed via Photoshop from <a

                        target="_blank">a 1839 edition of the Morning Herald</a> as a nod to the way in which newspapers
                      of the time made use of icons to enliven their layout and draw attention. Lastly, rounded edges
                      were removed from all boxes as they were not historically accurate.

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> We chose Art Deco as it is an early
                      20th century style more readily associated with architecture and material design than print, which
                      we felt would be more interesting. After some research we honed in on two options: the more
                      flamboyant aesthetic typical of posters of the era or the more subdued but still striking
                      aesthetic of key print publications, namely <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> from NYC and <em>Arts &amp;
                        D&#233;coration</em> from Paris. We chose the second as more realistic to achieve. Time wise we
                      pulled from the first half of the Art Deco movement, before WWI, with references to a 1925 issue
                      of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> and a 1921 issue of <em>Arts &amp; D&#233;coration</em>, taken from
                      the Internet Archive via <a
                        href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=artsanddecoration"
                        target="_blank">The Online Books Page resource</a>.</p>
                    <p>We chose to focus the colors on a simple palette. Black (#111) and white (#fff) for background
                      and text, largely due to the fact that we already made use of a yellow shade for the Newspaper
                      theme to imitate old paper and we were unable to ascertain the exact page color from the scans.
                      White seemed a likely historically accurate choice, with color primarily kept for covers. A dark
                      shade of magenta-pink (#6F1946) and a shade of green (#68A469) were used as complimentary colors,
                      inspired by a <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> 1922 cover. The magenta-pink allowed for an interesting
                      twist on background color for menus and metadata viewer while the green as a spot color was a nice
                      reference to jade, one of the natural materials used in Art Deco material designs such as jewelry
                      and furniture.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> Limelight was an obvious choice for the
                      branding, with its high contrast, geometric style instantly evoking our current understanding of
                      the era. Likewise, Poiret One was chosen as another cursive, sans-serif font that easily evokes
                      the era and would be better suited to titling so as not to have titles become overbearing. Prata
                      was chosen for the body as it emulated the contrast between curves and serifs seen in our
                      reference magazines. After trying out Poiret One but finding it too light, we opted for Cormorant
                      Garamond as the menu type. It felt like a good emulation of some of the title fonts in our
                      references and also has direct historical relationship to the 1920s as it is an open-source
                      adaption of Garamond which itself saw a revival during that period.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> One of the key layout elements we wanted
                      to emulate from our references was the use of geometric figures and embellishments as borders and
                      dividers. After doing some testing with images of historically accurate separators we opted to
                      instead make use of CSS pseudo-elements as these can more easily scale. We stumbled on two useful
                      bits of public code: a <a href="https://codepen.io/thewildmage/pen/ayewQw"
                        target="_blank">Codepen</a> with various Art Deco inspired separators, and a <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65758024/art-deco-style-border-in-css"
                        target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> thread with a simple double border frame. The latter was used
                      for the ToC and the former to embellish the cover title and blockquotes with corners, diamond
                      separators, and full frames. Returning to our references, we opted for double solid lines to frame
                      the cover images of each article, with additional padding on the images themselves to emphasize
                      the frame.</p>
                    <p>Based on our references, we centered headers, subheaders, bylines, and captions and added italics
                      to subheaders and captions and uppercase to bylines. Dropcaps were added to the beginning of each
                      article, followed by indents, both using pseudo-elements to control all the necessary instances
                      across the six articles using nth child logic. Due to the differences in some of the html
                      structures of the articles, we also had to create additional exceptions to ensure that dropcaps
                      and indents behaved correctly (and this was in turn taken across to other themes). The size of the
                      dropcaps and indent were taken from visual estimation of our references: around three lines-height
                      for primary dropcaps (two for secondary ones), no padding, and negative margin-bottom to ensure
                      text wrapped tightly; the length of 2 letters for indents (this indent length appeared to be
                      roughly the same across all historical themes and so was kept in all of them). The remaining
                      letters of the first word of each line were also uppercased as was the norm then. Bottom margin
                      was removed from paragraphs, and padding was kept around images in line with historical
                      references. We only kept rounded edges on the top corners as based on our references that appeared
                      like the most accurate use of rounded edges at the time. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> The choice of 1990s hip-hop
                      magazines for this theme was clear from the beginning, as the articles of the Death And Rebirth
                      issue were taken from issues of <em>The Source</em> and <em>Ego Trip Magazine</em>, two key US
                      publications for fans of the music at the time. With access to a large personal collection of
                      scans from these two publications and others (<em>XXL</em>, <em>Rap Pages</em>, and <em>Hip-Hop
                        Connection</em> among others) we first began to look for key aesthetic elements common to this
                      subset of music magazines from the decade. While each of these publications had a certain style,
                      there was an undeniable common aesthetic to hip-hop magazines of the time and we originally
                      considered making direct references to different publications before ultimately deciding that
                      <em>The Source</em> would be the direct reference, essentially speaking for all. Part of the
                      reason for this was that we had access to many different <em>Source</em> articles as reference,
                      compared with other magazines, and that it is historically one of the most important publications
                      of this specific subset.
                    </p>
                    <p>For our primary palette we decided on a very light shade of orange (#e1dcd8) as the main
                      background color and a medium shade (#DBBC9F) for the metada viewer, modals, and buttons. This
                      choice was inspired by some of the specific backgrounds in our reference documents. Text used a
                      very dark shade of blue-magenta (#222125) extracted from scans, which was also used for the navbar
                      in the spirit of how content pages and regular columns were presented. For primary spot colors we
                      used a shade of red (#d5473b) which was a common balance to the black in many issues as well as a
                      magenta (#70557D) and pink (#8c485f) for borders and highlights. The articles themselves feature
                      additional color combinations in the titles, which was inspired by the way in which 1990s music
                      magazines often called on a wide range of color combinations with each article often featuring its
                      own specific palette.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fonts:</span> After trying to analyse fonts used at the
                      time and doing some research we settled on a combination that we think evokes the spirit of the
                      times. Alfa Slab One was chosen for branding and titling as an old-style serif with a strong
                      visual effect that brings to mind some of the title fonts used by <em>The Source</em> in its early
                      days. Oswald was chosen as a clean gothic sans-serif ideal for blockquotes and dropcaps, evoking
                      some of the extra bold sans-serif used at the time. Glegoo felt ideal for menus with its slab
                      serif evoking print in very clear ways. Lastly, Libre Baskerville was chosen for the body, as
                      serifs tended to be common in body text at the time (though there was a switch to sans-serif in
                      the decade) and it is optimised for body usage on computers. </p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout:</span> The aim with the layout of this theme
                      was to try and capture how diverse the design of each article in hip-hop magazines was. Common
                      elements were chosen to tie it together, especially as we didn't have the luxury of multiple
                      pages: the use of uppercase for bylines and menus; straight corners on all borders, boxes, and
                      buttons; no background hover colors; the use of a small black square to indicate the end of an
                      article. After this we opted to recreate the layouts of the 3 different articles in Death And
                      Rebirth as these were most directly related to our magazine. Each article has therefore been as
                      closely recreated as possible, with the 1991 <em>Source</em> article about KMD featuring a
                      different, but historically accurate, lead photo to allow us to recreate the title's positioning.
                      For the second issue, we drew from the color combination and design styles of Source articles from
                      1991 and 1992 including the use of image cropping (recreated via CSS <code>clip-path</code>
                      property thanks to this <a href="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/" target="_blank">handy
                        resource</a>), line boxing around titles, and color alternation. Subheaders within article were
                      also styled in homage of the times with solid background colors, center alignment and small
                      dropcaps and letter spacing to control its stretching across the available space. Lastly, bottom
                      margins were removed from paragraphs, uppercase was applied to captions and bylines alonside an
                      underline for the latter, and text was justified based on references.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4vw;">Promptism is a movement
                      rooted in the technological advances of the 21st century that holds the potential to completely
                      transform artistic practices. Promptism was founded in response to the growing concern that
                      traditional art had become irrelevant to the modern world. Going beyond painting and sculpture,
                      Promptist art involves the manipulation of new media, specifically computer generated imagery,
                      animation, and the Internet. Its unique dynamism makes Promptism a dynamic vehicle for the
                      expression of identity and the implementation of real-time feedback between itself and the
                      spectator.</blockquote>

                    </figcaption>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspiration:</span> For our last trick we gave some
                      serious thoughts to how best to approach the spec's requirement that one of the themes be an
                      imagination of what the future of design look like. Keeping it üíØ we're not fans of predictions,
                      they just always seem so forced and rarely hit the spot (unless we're talking about speculative
                      fiction but let's not go there because it's too depressing). One early idea was to mint an NFT and
                      just make the entire website redirect to a blockchain entry, but we didn't have the money to be
                      honest and it felt like too much of a cop out (still think it's funny though). Eventually we
                      decided that it would be just as fun to use the current Promptist movement and advances in Machine
                      Learning to generate most of the CSS code via prompts given to a GPT model: <a
                        href="https://6b.eleuther.ai/" target="_blank">Eleuther AI's GPT-J-6B</a>.</p>
                    <p>That's right, all of the CSS in this theme was generated from prompts with the model's
                      suggestions refined and aligned to ensure the result wasn't too chaotic. The color scheme and
                      fonts were picked from simple prompts of partial Google Fonts URLs and CSS properties and then we
                      fed it the selectors we needed based on the default theme and continued along until we had
                      something workable.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we also generated new versions of all the images in our magazine using VGAN+CLIP <a
                        href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_4Jl0a7WIJeqy5LTjPJfZOwMZopG5C-W"
                        target="_blank">Colab</a> <a
                        href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nWkU3HlGBF5Gl_XjWs_k-QIDDB18nDpK"
                        target="_blank">notebooks</a>. The cover images were generated based on source image and title
                      as prompt with the CLIP Guided Diffusion approach by Katherine Crowson, while article images were
                      generated with source image and title as prompt from standard VGAN+CLIP models.</p>
                    <p>The original idea was to have the entire site be generated by prompts, including the text, and we
                      actually did generate alternate versions of each article but in the end finding a way to cleanly
                      subsitute everything proved too demanding so we settled for simply swapping the images using
                      Javascript.</p>
                    <p>While this theme started as a bit of a joke and pushback against the spec requirements, we do
                      think that Promptism, as the current movement of machine-enabled art has been coined by some,
                      offers a genuinely interesting take on what the future of art and content will look like. The
                      Promptist Manifesto, written by GPT-3, can be read <a
