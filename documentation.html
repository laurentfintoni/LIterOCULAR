    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        This is the documentation for the digital magazine LiterOCULAR, made by Federico Cagnola and Laurent Fintoni for
        2021’s Information modelling and web technologies course in the DHDK Master’s programme, held by professor Fabio
        Vitali.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our work on this digital magazine was a great opportunity to experiment with different website layout and styles
        as
        well as to practice our markup and aesthetic skills.
    </p>
    <p>As instructed in the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2020/454464">project
            assignment</a> we started looking for a suitable subject for the two issues we were tasked to make: our
        shared
        passion for US hip-hop culture quickly led us to the character and cultural icon that was <b>MF DOOM</b>, and
        after
        some
        time we chose <b>Timnit Gebru</b>’s case as the second subject, given the its relevance in modern times and its
        importance
        to our field of study in general.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Chapter I</h1>
    <p>
        During the first phase of our research we dug into the web to search for meaningful pieces of text which could
        suit
        our
        project and the academic goal of building an enhanced reading experience. The complete list of sources and
        articles
        we
        gathered can be found in the “Disclaimer” section of our website.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the <b>first issue</b>, centered around the character of MF DOOM, we chose print-only magazines as sources:
        these
        articles
        spanned over seven years, from DOOM’s beginnings within the KMD group, to the loss of his brother, to his return
        as
        MF
        DOOM. In order to transform them into digitally encoded text, we used the pytesseract library in Python to
        extract
        all
        three articles, and captured embedded images with Adobe Photoshop.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process was very different for the <b>second issue</b>: the theme was Timnit Gebru’s incident at Google’s
        Ethics
        Division
        which ultimately caused her termination. Since the subject was close in time, all sources were already available
        in
        digital format: we retrieved the texts from online versions of The New York Times, MIT Tech Review and WAPO.
        These
        articles only span six months between each other, and detail the firing of Gebru as well as the larger theme of
        AI
        bias,
        which ultimately led to her dismissal.
    </p>

    <h1>Chapter II</h1>
    <p>
        After gathering the texts our markup work began, and in a couple of weeks all texts were marked up with a common
        strategy which would enable the implementation of the website’s functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        We chose to give all texts a common
        layout, where headers would have a
        <code>h1</code> tag and most of the article would be in
        <code>p</code> tags. We added figures
        and
        <code>blockquotes</code> as necessary and then dove into the articles themselves, reflecting on the content and
        on
        what
        would be
        worthy of mention for our analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        We started from the themes of our articles, music, racism,artificial intelligence
        <i>artificial intelligence</i>,identityreligionpeople
        placesto meventsconcepts such as <i>identity</i> and <i>religion</i>, and finally added useful tags to any
        <i>people</i>,
        <i>places</i> or <i>events</i> we found relevant. All important words or sentences were enclosed in a
        <code>span</code> tag with a
        class of
        <code>mention-*</code> where * would stand for the kind or class of mention and an additional attribute of
        <code>about=”*”</code>
        would clarify
        the specific entity mentioned. This double system, which was implemented partly by hand and partly through
        regular
        expressions
        matching, finally allowed us to have properly marked up text which in turn enabled the “intelligent”
        functionality
        of
        the website.
    </p>

    <h1>Chapter III.1</h1>
    <h3>Base theme</h3>
    <p>TODO</p>

    <h1>Chapter III.2</h1>
    <h3>Newspaper theme</h3>
    <p>For the Newspaper-inspired theme we turned to Guilty Novin's exhaustive article for inspiration. The layout
        certainly had to be preserved (simple columns) but many quirks and details could be added to give the look and
        feel of proper modern newspapers.</p>
    <p>The first thing that caught our attention was the extensive use of drop caps, a typographic technique where the
        first letter of a paragraph or sentence is much bigger and often emphasized in color than the following block of
        text. This could be achieved in pure CSS by adding a rule targeting the <code>::first-letter</code> selector and
        increasing the size and padding.</p>
    <p>Then, we felt the color palette was the next natural step, so after researching
        the best shades that could go with our styles we chose the color palette: a dark gray (<code>#353434</code>), a
        yellow-ish gray for the background (<code>#ebe7dd</code>) and a slightly toned-down black (<code>#111</code>)
        for the text, in order to maintain high contrast and legibility.</p>
    <p>At this moment we noticed that the images were out of sync with the rest of the page, since they were
        modern-looking in
        their wide color gamut: we decided to apply a CSS filter to render all images as greyscale, which drastically
        improved the overall look of the page.</p>
