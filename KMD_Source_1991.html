<p>Ntzoke Shange once told me, “If Black kids in <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</span> have to call each other God to feel good about themselves, then that’s great. Anything that makes Black kids feel good about themselves is great.” When <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> is teamed up with <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="BrandNubian">Brand Nubian</span> they call themselves <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="TheGodSquad">The God Squad</span>. That must make them feel good about themselves. I know I feel good about myself. I feel good when I’m listening to <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="NittyGritty">“Nitty Gritty”</span> and Lord Jamar says, <span id="#" class="mention-rhyme" about="NittyGritty">“Stop wearin the Cross/ Do for self/ Kill that yes sir boss.”</span> Or when Derek X warns, <span id="#" class="mention-rhyme" about="NittyGritty">“Zig Zag, Zig/ Watch the Blackman get big... bury all the devils/ With <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> I can raise up my levels.”</span></p>

<p>I'm loving that shit! Damn right, bury all the devils. They’ve been burying us for years. I feel good every time I listen to that. I feel good because I’m a Blackman and Black people is what that song is all about. That's what the <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="TheGodSquad">God Squad</span> is all about. That’s what <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> is all about.</p>

<p>Kausin’ Much Damage or <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> are <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span>, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Onyx">Onyx the Birthstone Kid</span>, and the DJ, <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Subroc">Subroc</span>, three kids from <span id="#" class="mention-location" about="LongIsland">Long Island</span> that make dope music. They just dropped one of the most original and innovative albums since <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="PeoplesInstinctiveTravels">People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</span>. Their debut LP, <span id="#" class="mention-album" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span> (<span id="#" class="mention-label" about="Elektra">Elektra</span>) overflows with sounds new to <span id="#" class="mention-genre" about="hip-hop">hip-hop</span>—like the string loop on <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="HardWitNoHoe">“Hard Wit No Hoe”</span>—and gives birth to new concepts like <span id="#" class="mention-sample" about="SesameStreet">Bert from Sesame Street</span> humming along with <span id="#" class="mention-group" about="KMD">KMD</span> for three and-a-half minutes on <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="Humrush">“Humrush.”</span></p>

<p>Another new concept is the fact that you're guided through the album by <span id="#" class="mention-character" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span> himself. <span id="#" class="mention-character" about="Mr.Hood">Mr. Hood</span> is some character that only speaks in samples, and appears throughout the album, sometimes on songs and sometimes between them. <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev</span> said that he is on the album so that he can be “the ignorant kid from around the way.” If they have that, they can teach him (and the listeners) different things throughout the album. They do try to get a message across on every song, so I asked him to explain a couple of them. I started with <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="HardWitNoHoe">“Hard Wit No Hoe”</span> because it’s one of the trickier cuts:</p> 

<p><em><span id="#" class="mention-person" about="ZevLoveX">Zev Love X</span></em>: The whole concept is how Black men treat Black Women. If we knew that the Black woman is a goddess, if we knew that she is beautiful, and if we really felt that, then we wouldn’t treat her like we do.</p> 

<p>The reason that we treat her like we do is because society is set up to make us think that the Black woman is not pretty. Like Johnny Gill said, “put on your red dress, put on your high heels.” High heels is to make a woman look like she has a rear-end. Lipstick is to make a woman look like she has full lips. The Black woman has all of this. But she has to put that on for him to want her? As beautiful as the original woman is, we should want her for that. If the Blackman is not providing for the Black woman, she is going to cling on to anything that <em>is</em> providing for her. Whether it be Welfare or a white man. When we see a Black woman walking down the street with a white man, we get upset, but we don’t have the right to do that, because in many cases <em>we</em> messed up [causing] them to mess up. First comes Knowledge then Wisdom. On the song I say, <span id="#" class="mention-rhyme" about="HardWitNoHoe">“When you grow up to be a farmer, keep an eye on your yard/ Cause with no hoe it’s hard.”</span> You’ve got to keep an eye on your cipher and see what’s goin’ on, because if you lose that Black woman life is hard, G.</p> 

<p><span id="#" class="mention-track" about="PreacherPorkchop">“Preacher Porkchop”</span> is a spoof on [<span id="#" class="mention-group" about="BrandNubian">Brand Nubian</span>’s] <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="WakeUp">“Wake Up.”</span> You know where they say <span id="#" class="mention-rhyme" about="WakeUp">“Putting money in the pan/ For the rest of the week now I’m eating out of soup cans/ He’s got a home, drives a Caddy through town.”</span> <span id="#" class="mention-character" about="PreacherPorkchop">Preacher Porkchop</span> is a rebel. The Church didn’t accept him because he wanted to see what was true and what wasn’t true, he didn’t want to take people’s money...</p> 

<p>Religion is supposed to be for your mind, body and soul, but if you go to church, a preacher will preach one little scripture for hours. It may be good for your soul... the singing and the hand clapping, but what is that doing for your mind? We all are Ansaar [Muslim] including <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Onyx">Onyx</span>, whose father is a Christian preacher. The only difference between the <span id="#" class="mention-organization" about="FivePercentNation">Five Percent Nation</span> muslim and Ansaar is that <span id="#" class="mention-organization" about="FivePercentNation">Five Percents</span> believe they are the creator and we believe that there is one creator that created everything in existence but the Blackman is God. Everything else we agree upon: The white man is the devil. We agree he oppressed many different people. We agree that we have to uplift our race. We agree that we're the original man. We agree that the Black woman needs to be respected. We agree that the Black family needs to be saved...</p>

<blockquote>...We believe that there is one creator that created everything in existence, but the Blackman is GOD.</blockquote>

<p>It’s not that hard to break into the white-owned music industry and still call them devils on wax. You gotta *sneak* up in shit, make ‘em think you down and sneak up and snuff ‘em! I’m sneakin up on niggas, G! I’m not sleepin. I got <span id="#" class="mention-person" about="Serch">Serch</span> and them sayin what I couldn’t say on <span id="#" class="mention-track" about="GasFace">“Gas Face.”</span> I got them sayin <span id="#" class="mention-rhyme" about="GasFace">“Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black/Must have been a white guy that started all that.”</span> I can’t say that and come out with no album. They'd shoot me down from the start. “What's this kid talking about? Oh, that old Black shit. Go back to Africa with that!”</p>

<p>Check it out. The devils is rollin’ together, then they divide us... ”You’re Puerto Rican. You're Jamaican. You're Black.” So they have us all against each other. We all are Nubians. They put different names on shit to try to make us seem different. Let’s all get together and blow shit up!</p>

<p>I'll tell you what else. The devils always make the first move and mess up, and once you try to retaliate, they say you're the bad one. Like, they say Adam was white. Jesus was white. As soon as you say “I have proof the Prophets was Black,” you're the racist. I'm not no racist; it’s a fact. If you didn’t say he was white, I wouldn't have to say he was Black, ‘cause it would be common knowledge.</p>
