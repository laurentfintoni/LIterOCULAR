“Many Flows. Metal Face. Mic Friendly, Magnetic Field, Money Flow. as well as My Friend and oh yeah—Mutha Fucka.” says M.F. Doom in explanation of the M.F. prefix on his name. Mutha Fucka is the third album by the group Doom, featuring Doom‘s first lineup since 1990’s The Beyond, as well as two previously unreleased outtakes. The album is M.F. Doom‘s first with the Doom Family, with vocalist Mikey Havoc, bassist Mike McPheeters, guitarist K.A.A. Volume One and drummer Joe Vibranz. After Havoc left the group to join Death Angel, Doom took a brief hiatus until he rejoined the group. The band then began working on this album for a while before releasing it late in 2015. I have had a ton of issues when attempting to listen to albums that I find interesting, but there is something that I always find intriguing in albums by or featuring artists in different genres. 

I have had a few albums in my collection labeled as “Metal” but they all seem to me to be different in tone. Perhaps I am just not seeing the difference. Or perhaps it is the “dime-store” vibe that I am getting from many of these bands. I understand that these types of bands are the “cool” kids of today but there has to be a difference between a band like The Sword or the mighty Black Sabbath. What makes them so much better than any other band out there? I have a couple of albums that I am not crazy about but I am very disappointed to have to give those out to be sold as collectibles to other collectors. These albums do not really fit into the criteria I use to judge any album. A band that plays a genre that most people do not like. This one is not that difficult to explain. It seems like a given that a band like this would not be as successful as another band with a similar style. 

Officially pared down to the duo of Zev Love X and Subroc, KMD struck back at the world with a most astounding aesthetic realignment. Love X’s production was a series of experiments with textures, his own brand of ‘drip-drip’ and the new sound came into it courtesy of Love X’s live drumming: the sound of a machine gun, a drum machine and a snare loop. Love X’s style brought a completely new perspective to what techno could be – so, so cool. Subroc on the other hand, was all about the drums – and his unique beats. He was also much more focused on his own personal sound. Much more focused even than Zev; his sound was more rooted in a dance floor vibe. At the same time, he also found a way to bring out the beauty of the ‘drip-drip’ sound from Love X’s production. With this, Subroc’s sound came into it with an old fashioned house influence and a bassline that was as organic as the beats.

But shortly after completing this masterpiece, tragedy befell the group when Subroc was fatally struck by a car on the Island. She had survived this tragedy and was in full bloom. The remaining members took to the road, continuing their journey, but they came into conflict with the many bandits who were robbing and killing in the area. In time, they caught one of the bandits and he came to them. The young knight asked them the same question the young king of the story must have asked, and the group responded with the story. After the story was finished, Subroc was handed back to her mother and she went back to sleep. This happened every night after she became aware of the events of the story until the next day when she was woken up and this continued until she died. The young king was content, as he could now rest easy as he did not have to worry about anything that had happened the previous night. He was able to put this ordeal behind him, and so began his reign as king of the story.

Ntzoke Shange once told me, that there are two kinds of women: the ones who need men and the ones who don't. And that was it. No elaboration. Like that. He was a powerful writer who believed in the value of self-examination. As such, his writing on psychology and history was as relevant to the world today as it was in the 1930s. In many ways, the first installment of this series looked like a disaster - or at least, it did if you were reading the other four installments and you caught the same problems - but what I had to say about the issue was way too small. 

I'm loving that shit! The way I see it, it's not my money anymore. And I don't even care about that shit at all. And that goes for all these other people too. They don't even have a phone number so they have nothing to lose, and they have to call anyone who has anyone, like the president. You know, that's like the best part about the whole thing is how the president has this ability to just, to be really, really, really smart. He was going to be president when the economy was going to tank -- and there was this one company, and that company was going to run things -- well, he found that company and he put them in charge. Well, it didn't happen that way or the situation would certainly have evolved a very different way. The point is that people don't have complete control over their life. No, it had to happen that way. 

Kausin’ Much Damage or KMD are Zev Love X, Onyx the Birthstone Kid, and the DJ, Subroc, three kids from Long Island that make dope music. All their tracks can be found on their SoundCloud page. The Bowery Ballroom The Bowery Ballroom (a.k.a. “The Bowery”) is the largest of three ballrooms on the Lower East Side, and the oldest of them. In 1913, a British Army captain named John Godfrey Dixon, with an engineer company, had been called upon to take part in an assault on the fortress that was thought to have been built of reinforced concrete. 

The whole concept is how Black men treat Black Women. If Blacks have sex with White girls why not Black guys have sex with Black Girls. Do you think all guys who have sex with Black Women are Black Men? Why don’t white girls want us to talk about racism? How can we talk about racism without talking about race? I’ve been asked why we can’t talk about racism without talking about race.  

The reason that we treat her like we do is because society is set up to make us think that the Black woman is not pretty. I don't know how you can say that, but I've heard it so many times and its been said by so many people in so many different ways; one of my favorite examples was when a friend of mine told me she had never thought about being white until she got to college. She didn't think there was anything wrong with her race, and yet after meeting a few other black people at school (and finding out they were all just as racist as the ones she had known in high school), she decided that it would be best if he did not know what she was doing. "I have no wish to cause you any trouble, but I must do something," said Mrs Sparrow. "It is a pity that Mr Sparrow should go away without knowing the truth." 

Religion is supposed to be for your mind, body and soul, but what happens when it becomes the only thing that matters? I’m not talking about an all-out spiritual awakening or a sudden conversion. I’m talking about the gradual loss of everything else as we try to hold on to our sanity by clinging to religion at any cost. It’s not that hard to break into the white-owned music industry and still call them devils on wax. The easiest path is to be a top-tier independent artist, like the legendary hip-hop artist Taka Boom, who has released over 20 albums and one EP. His latest album “Majesty” was released in September 2017 on Def Jam Recordings/Sony Music Entertainment with production from DJ Khalil, Dizzy Wright, Cirkut & Illmind.

Zev Love X seems to be in low spirits. He was one of the few people who said what he thought about Donald Trump and had little to no faith in the rest of the political class that voted for him. The president-elect's victory over Hillary Clinton was a surprise to most of the nation, but it was not an unexpected one. On election night, polls showed Donald Trump with a narrow lead over his Democratic rival in the Electoral College and at least enough support from Republicans to win on Election Day itself. 

Zev seems to have more on his mind than self promotion. As a result, he is not always the most accurate source of information regarding the state of our economy or the state of the markets. However, in the case of any significant news (of which there has been plenty recently), he will be able to provide some insight for the media and for people in general. I’m curious how he thinks the current media is going to cover this one. He writes about what he finds funny, but how does he think the public will react? To me, it seemed like a guy who knows what he wants when he wants it, and works harder than he's ever worked before.  

Inspired by Last Poet Gylan Kain’s raw Afrocentric spoken jazz album. The audio of the performance has not been edited. It does not sound different if I play it straight. Sometimes the recording is so strong I am unable to separate the live and the recording, because it is hard to tell what's live and what's recorded. So I am always surprised when the live shows are so different from the recordings--I would usually just assume that one or the other was doctored or mis-recorded. Either that or they're just trying to kill two birds with one stone.

Zev exhales like a dragon, stoically answers questions, and tells his story with authority. His story begins in December 1990, when he was eleven years old and attending a public junior kindergarten in Dharavi. He was about nine months away from doing what now seems to be impossible. Before he was born, it was becoming a given. He was just a few weeks shy of turning 10. His mother would have been proud of him.

“I wasn’t even with him that day, but the shit was shady,” recalled the president’s former press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who was asked about the meeting at the White House. “I was really excited to see it,’’ said one of the players. “I had just started playing in college in the early 2000s and I remember not wanting to take any money for it out of fear that you end up getting hooked by the mob and your bank account is gone.” 

Many KMD insiders insist that Zev is in a state of denial. "Most of the time, he doesn't know that those things are happening," says Oleg. "We haven't told him, 'It's on the way,'" but I think we have been very clear to him that he is our best player. I mean, he is one of, if not our better player." With this win over Georgia, Notre Dame's winning percentage over teams ranked in the Associated Press poll has increased to 59.3 percent. Notre Dame defeated No. 8 Maryland in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for the fourth time this season. 

When he listens to the music, we see he really loves it! I used to work with a guy who worked in a record label, and he was a little older than me. He was a really nice guy, and I really like him a lot. But the guy was a bit of a dick, and I kind of resented him for a little bit. I thought, “Hey, why don’t I just work with this guy?” I really thought I could be a better singer, and he was the guy who could give me advice. He was a lot older than me, and I thought I could get better tips from him. And he was kind of like a mentor to me. He said, “You know, you’re going to make it big someday.” And I thought that was really cool. 

Their mother is coping, Zev continues, nodding his head and considering her pain. "I think it's for the best." "I've been there, Zev. But I can't do that anymore." He nods again. "Okay." "When my father passed, I tried to tell him. I said, 'Hey, it's okay. You can't change your fate. You're gonna die here.'" She sighs. "It didn't work. He didn't believe me. But I'm telling you now. You don't want to go to Hell. You don't want to die like my dad." "What about your mother?" "I didn't want to lose her." "Then why did you? You've already lost everything."

“It’s like this: the physical body is not us anyway,” Zev continues, “so we don’t have to take it seriously. We have to take ourselves seriously. If we don’t take ourselves seriously, we’re not human. We’re not human.” In a way, it seems like Zev is taking a page from the Buddha’s teachings on the subject of impermanence. “What we think about as ‘me’ and ‘mine’ doesn’t last,” he says. “I don’t have to be the same person I was five years ago. I can change, I can evolve, I can grow.” In the video, Zev explains that in the last few years, he has been working on an ambitious project in his spare time. Zev explains how he has been working on a prototype of a full-scale solar-powered car that he hopes to bring to market in 2020. The company hopes to make an initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, raising at least $500 million and launching a production run of 150 cars. In his video, Zev explains that he has been working on a prototype of a full-scale solar-powered car that he hopes to bring to market in 2020.

Hundreds of people gathered for the first lecture by a black scientist at a university in the U.S. and received a dose of racist “factoids” to help them in their studies, according to documents recently obtained by The Huffington Post. Timnit Gebru, then a graduate student at Stanford University, remembers his friend Timing’s excitement in the spring of 1980 for his first trip to Israel. “I think he realized that he had a real calling,” said George Whitmore when I asked him about the future president’s decision to make his own legacy. “I think he realized more than I think he realized,” said Bill. “And I’m not sure he realizes it yet.”

“I think it’s all been a huge shock to him and it’s taken him a while to recover. He’s just not the same. In his own mind he thinks he’s better, but he is much closer to the same point than he is to the point where he would be. He has a life, a home, a spouse, and a kid. He has a good memory. He remembers what has happened to him the day before. He remembers his mother. He remembers his father. He remembers all the things that have happened around him for the last five, six years."

The A.I. community buzzed about the mini-manifesto. “It’s not going to be like the Star Wars movies—it’s going to be better,” said Lucasfilm vice president of new media and internet programming. “Lucasfilm is a pioneer in the creation of digital entertainment experiences for fans around the world and our goal is to continue the legacy of our filmmakers and of the franchise they create." 

About six years ago, A.I. in a Google online photo service was trying to analyze a photo using a neural network. Its neural network is very powerful, with up to five layers of deep neural network that can learn the relationships between different pixels. In 2018, when I told Google’s public relations staff  that I was quitting my job as a PR executive, they replied that they had read my blog and were impressed with my experience. This was before the full consequences of Google’s recent acquisition of Motorola, when the company decided to kill off the Moto G phone in favor of the first-generation Moto X, a $399 (about £290) phone with a more affordable 5-inch screen.

But nearly three years later, Dr. Gebru was pushed out of his job. "He was doing a very good job," said Gebru's lawyer, Peter Miller. The company decided, at great expense, to buy the whole thing and convert it to open access, and now has it open. With this, it can turn the entire library into a searchable, fully searchable database. You can search by title, by author, by content, or by publication date. 

Their departure became a point of contention for A.I. researchers who hoped the robots would stay on their own and learn to communicate with humans. In the end, no compromise was reached and the robots were sent off to the far side of the world to do their job. I am not suggesting that the government was in any way wrong to send them there. In fact, I do know how to use the tools. That's the point. The tools to use. And those tools are the key to me. You know, like, I'm not going to get into the tools.

It should have been a wake-up call.

Noah’s generation — those born in the late '70s and '80s, when the first video game consoles were launched — grew up playing games on their own time, and that they don’t have a lot of friends, but that they do enjoy being around their friends. There was an overwhelming sense that she enjoyed living with a host, but the host didn't  seem to share her sense. As soon as she left the house, she noticed that he wouldn't answer her calls.

As a software engineer, Mr. Alciné understood the problem. He also understood how deeply the problem cut him, as a young man, deep in the heart of his home. If he had to tell you about what was happening to his family, he couldn't. "When his family got together, they didn't stay together." "They fought..." "They fought like cats and dogs." "Maybe he didn't like that." 

Before joining Google, Dr. Gebru collaborated on a study with a young computer scientist, Steven Levy, that became one of the most influential papers in the history of computer science — arguably the single-most important innovation in the field. She gravitated toward facial recognition technology. ‘My first reaction was no, I’m not going to be in the database,’ she said. But that was short-lived. ‘It turns out there’s a lot more to life than what you were taught in school: you don’t have to go through life alone.’

“Black Skin, White Masks,” she said in an interview, describing how she was able to make her way in New York’s fashion industry as a black woman without being harassed or ostracized. I love the new design of the T&A Store, and I think it's awesome that it's not only about saving money and having a bigger wallet, but also the new way to take care of the products you love.

She found that when the services read photos of lighter-​skinned men, they were more likely to be charged more. In a study of 1.9 million Facebook adverts found by the New York Daily News, the darker the skin, the more likely advertisers were to be interested in you.

The first question then is of course. What the hell is this thing?"

"An alien warhorse, like the one out on the ice in the Arctic. Only much bigger and much, much deadlier. And I'm not the first to say it, either: When I was 19, I had to go to a school clinic with a head wound. They sewed it up, but instead of using the standard method of butterfly stitches, they did half-double crochet stitches, meaning each stitch had two loops on the hook. Now they had a lot of stitches to crochet.  

Twelve months later, Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that allowed for the legalization of medical marijuana.

In May of 2013, Seattle became the first North American city to legalize medical marijuana. It wasn’t the first to put forward such a position. It was in The Atlantic in March, after months of study. In it, John J. Miller, “the dean of American conservatives,” and Michael Ignatieff, “the most famous Canadian intellectual in America” offer “an extraordinary array of arguments” for “Theorem 1 and the proofs” from the Appendix and then conclude: “The final step in the proof is the statement of Theorem 1 and the proofs that follow."

Timnit MIT

On the evening of Wednesday, December 2, Timnit Gebru, the co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, was having dinner with co-founder Sergey Brin and three other researchers. The conversation turned to the future of the U.S. economy. They discussed, among other things, how the Fed was likely to hike interest rates and what that would mean for the markets.

A series of tweets, leaked emails, and media articles showed that Gebru’s exit was triggered not by internal disagreements but by his political opponents.

Gebru’s departure, said the sources, was a result of his opposition to the government’s controversial plan to cut power tariffs by 50 percent on August 1 while shutting down all coal-fired power plants. Gebru had also been involved in the production of the film "Woyzeck" starring Orson Welles, as well as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" directed by Georges Méliès.

“On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” lays out evidence that language models that make use of words as input parameters are prone to overfitting and fail to generalize well. 

The paper, which builds on the work of other researchers, presents evidence that a virus called MERS-CoV actually is a genetic hybrid of two strains of the virus — MERS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV-2. 

Training large AI models consumes a lot of computing resources. There is a reason why we need to train large AI models: It takes many iterations of large training models to learn in their new environment. The more accurate your model is, the stronger your results will be. With our interactive, easy-to-understand models, your students can better visualize what is going on, and the impact of the factors they are learning about.

Large language models are also trained on exponentially increasing amounts of data. Most of the recent work on language models have followed the practice of training on a small number of large amounts of training text, and then finetuning these models to fine-tune the parameters from the corresponding pretrained models, and finally fine-tuning the fine-tuned models to fine-tune the parameters from the last pretrained model.

Moreover, because the training data sets are so large, a single dataset may contain all of the possible data (such as all of the items in a shopping list, the words in a document, or the colors of the irises in an iris). 

The final problem with large language models, the researchers say, is that they’re not necessarily accurate on the English-language side. In some cases, their models actually over-predict the number of translations each language will have, but the error rate remains at a low rate.

The results of the experiment may indicate that languages that are more closely related to English tend to use words with more morphological information in their lexicons, a finding in line with previous studies.

Gebru and Bender’s paper has six coauthors, four of whom are Google researchers. One is a former Google employee who was not involved in the publication of that paper and is now a consultant to the company. The paper was submitted on the deadline and is on-track for published version at the end of 2018. We thank the organizers for the opportunity and all the reviewers for their critical and helpful reviews.

Timnit WaPo

Gebru is one of the most high-profile Black women in her field and a powerful voice in the new field of ethical AI. We recently caught up with Gebru and discussed the future of AI ethics and AI-driven ethics.

Two months ago, Google promoted Timnit Gebru, co-lead of a group focused on ethical artificial intelligence, to its director of technology and ethics. His promotion was first rumored at the beginning of the year, when Google also hired an Android head and a former Apple exec. In Google’s latest internal report for May 2016, Motorola Mobility co-founder Rick Osterlof wrote that the company was “going to be OK” and that “we all know what we need to do.”

Six weeks later, Google fired Gebru while she was on vacation. After the phone call, Google suspended her for two days without pay. That means, Google would have to replace her with a new employee with the exact same qualifications, which is not at all likely.

In an internal memo that he later posted online explaining Gebru’s departure, Wainwright said that “Gebru’s recent comments have led to a number of issues, including a potential inability to maintain a good working relationship with the other directors on this committee.”

Gebru, Wainwright said, is “not open to constructive criticism and, unfortunately, has proven himself to be not a team player.”

Gebru did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

“We have a very solid team of people,” Wainwright said in an interview. “It wasn’t that we weren’t in position to play the way we wanted to. It was the inability to put our foot on the ball. That was it. It was that simple.”

Wainwright has won two World Series in his 10 years with the Cardinals. He has lost three. This is his second trip to the Fall Classic as a manager and, for the Cardinals, it’s the fifth straight time they have been in a play-in game.

It raises doubts about Silicon Valley’s ability to self-police, as well as how well that self-policing actually works.

The company did not return a request for comment.

This is the second time the company has faced allegations of sexism. Last year, in the same publication, its co-founder and then-CEO Susan Fowler wrote about how she experienced sexual harassment at the company.

The company’s response to that alleged incident has been widely criticized for being insufficient. The company, as well as Uber, have also come under fire in recent weeks for allegedly not doing enough to prevent sexual harassment and abuse by drivers.

Although Google publicly celebrated Gebru’s work identifying problems with AI, she was forced to resign from the project. “I resigned because I felt that Google was not able to provide the right ethical guidance that is needed for the project,” she wrote. “Google’s leadership has made clear that they want AI to do evil things, and they were unwilling to stand up to that view.”

Nearly 3,000 Google employees and more than 4,000 academics, engineers and industry colleagues have signed a petition urging the company to withdraw its membership from the controversial Global Climate Coalition, an industry group formed to develop a "consensus on a climate change plan to be released at the upcoming UNFCCC conference in December."

The coalition, organized in 2005 by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Petroleum Institute, is reportedly being backed by the American Chemistry Council, which represents more than 500 of the nation's largest chemical companies, and the American Petroleum Institute.

Like any good researcher, Gebru is comfortable in the gray areas. And like any good scientist, he’s keenly aware of the limitations of research. So he won’t claim that his research definitively answers the question. Instead, he’s building up a research program that’s as likely to support his conclusions as it is to contradict them.

His basic question is this: “Does being human, or being a human parent, make it more or less likely that a child will turn out well?”

Tech giants have made similar investments in shaping policy debate around antitrust and online privacy, but their efforts have met with mixed success. Google has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying in recent years, and its political advocacy has yielded little concrete impact on the Trump administration’s antitrust and privacy agendas. Facebook, meanwhile, has become a central figure in the Cambridge Analytica scandal — but its more recent lobbying efforts have largely focused on regulatory issues.

Apple’s lobbying activity in 2018 has been largely consistent with its efforts in 2017, though the company has also become a bigger player in the privacy and antitrust spaces. Facebook has become the largest company to publicly disclose its lobbying activities, having spent $19.

Gebru’s approach to ethical AI was shaped by her experiences. Hardware, for instance, is “a bit like playing the stock market,” she said. The field is a hot market, and it attracts “a lot of attention from a lot of different types of people.” One might be an “innovation-seeking entrepreneur,” she said, while another “might be the DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] program manager who is trying to bring hardware products to market.” Both types of people have “completely different perspectives” on where to focus the ethical AI effort.
